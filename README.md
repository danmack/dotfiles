# basic unix dot files for bash and emacs

nothing special here, I've just decided to put a set of starter
dotfiles on github instead of manually copying them from machine
to machine.

 - .emacs        - my basic emacs setup
 - .inputrc      - this makes bash for tolerable for me; it allows
                   tcsh type searching of history using the ESC-p
                   and ESC-n controls instead of bash's CTRL-r method
 - .bash_profile - simple bash_profile that shows how to wire up
                   git status
